Create a C++ program with a class named Animal that includes multiple private class members. Ensure that at least one of these members is dynamically allocated. Implement a copy constructor to create objects and modify them to observe the results. Identify which class members are deep copied and which are shallow copied. Additionally, provide a solution to address the shallow copy issue.
